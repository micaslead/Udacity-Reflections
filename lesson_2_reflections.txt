What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git folder is created so git can track commits & associated changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

working directory isn't tracked yet (new stuff)
staging area .. almost ready for tracking
repository ... changes should be good ... ready for testing

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

git diff --staged
will tell you what you added/removed in the staged file(s) compared to the "good" repository files


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
